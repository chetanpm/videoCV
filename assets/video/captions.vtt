Hi, I’m Chetan PM. I work in real-time control systems for precision machineries.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:16.000
But at my core, I just love building things. I’ve always been drawn to open-access projects—whether it’s software, hardware, or robotics.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Mainly because there were a lot people who helped me learn by doing things and improve on what’s already out there bit by bit.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:35.000
That mindset has shaped how I approach problem-solving: keeping things transparent, figuring things out hands-on, and refining through iterations.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.000
Most of my projects starts with the mechanical design.

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:49.000
But since complex systems needed more than that. Over the years, I’ve learnt to develop electronics hardware and program softwares for the control systems

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.000
by collaborating with scientists and engineers around me to turn research ideas into working prototypes.

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:12.000
For instance I’ve helped develop an aerostatic spindle for ultra-precision diamond turning machining, a four-axis tabletop milling machine using LinuxCNC, Mesa FPGA, and Trinamic ICs for motion control components.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:17.000
I just enjoy taking an idea from concept to reality.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:25.000
I like working independently, but I also thrive in environments where people bounce ideas off each other

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.000
challenge my initial assumptions, and build something better together.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.000
That’s why I’m excited about research—it’s not just about solving the problems but also about learning new ways to approach them.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:44.000
I’d love to bring my experience and curiosity into a team that values both.

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.000
And also… yeah, I want to build an Ironman suit eventually. Thanks for your time
